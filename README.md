## Deployment notes

The master branch of this repo is connected to the https://sandsnews.com, thus any changes merged into it will go live, work in the devel/responsive branch will appear at

https://devel.sn.nevexo.space and https://responsive.sn.nevexo.space respectively.

Once the codebase is large enough, this branch will be removed in favour of the devel branch.
